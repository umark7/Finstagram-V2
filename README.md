# Finstagram
Finstagram is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram, but made from scratch with a full backend and frontend.
**V1** was an implementation of the backend and a basic frontend to set up the site. 
**V2** brings in a fully working backend and frontend, with options to post pictures, videos, comments, and profile viewing!
**V3** is currently in the works and will add: better, fluid UI/UX similar to Instagram, reduced latency timings for accessing the app by hosting on Heroku, and a "Explore" feature!

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total
